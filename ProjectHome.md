Amyloid fibers have long been associated with several debilitating diseases and with proteinâ€™s expression and purification problems in the field of biotechnology. However growing evidence of specific biological functions are now arising and the extraordinary self-assembly and controlled fibrillation potential is currently being exploited as source for new nanomaterials. Despite fibril structural similarity, proteins that can undergo structural changes which lead to amyloid formation are quite diverse and share no obvious sequence or structural homology. The knowledge of which peptides and proteins undergo amyloid formation and the driving forces responsible for amyloid-like fiber formation and stabilization are thus of paramount importance.

This project holds a new predictor that was developed based on a machine learning approach through recursive feature selection and feed-forward neural networks,that have been proven capable of accurately and reliably predict the amyloidogenic propensity from the polypeptide sequence alone.
